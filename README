INSTALLATION

MacVim / Vim (if not already installed)

brew install macvim --override-system-vim --enable-clipboard
Add /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin in your $PATH so you use the version of brew
installed by Homebrew, not the one that comes with MacOS.

By installing Vim in this way MacVim and regular Vim are exactly the same.

This Distro

You will already have a ~/.vim folder, either delete or move it.

mv ~/.vim ~/.vim.old
git clone THIS REPOS ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim
rake install

Install Dependacies

brew install ack
brew install ctags

Tested on MacOS, should work on an Unix-like OS. Just replace the use of brew
with your package manager
