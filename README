INSTALLATION

MacVim / Vim (if not already installed)

brew install macvim --override-system-vim --enable-clipboard
Add /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin in your $PATH so you use the version of brew
installed by Homebrew, not the one that comes with MacOS.

This Distro

You will already have a ~/.vim folder, either delete or move it.

I recommend cloning this repo (and any other you may like to try) to some
directory other than ~/ and symlinking to the one you wish to use.

I keep my vim distro's in ~/Applications/vim

mkdir -p ~/Applications/vim
cd ~/Applications/vim
git clone THISREPOS rvim 
cd rvim
rake install
mv ~/.vim ~/Applications/vim/original
ln -s ~/Applications/vim/rvim ~/.vim

Install Dependacies

brew install ack
brew install ctags

Tested on MacOS, should work on an Unix-like OS. Just replace the use of brew
with your package manager
